  ITDB02_tinyFAT16.h - Add-on library to integrate ITDB02_Graph16 and tinyFAT
  Copyright (C)2010-2011 Henning Karlsen. All right reserved
  
  Basic functionality of this library are based on the demo-code provided by
  ITead studio. You can find the latest version of the library at
  http://www.henningkarlsen.com/electronics

  This library has been made especially for the 3.2" TFT LCD Screen Module: 
  ITDB02-3.2 by ITead studio. This library has been designed to use 16bit mode, 
  and it should work with the 2.4" Module in 16bit mode as well, although I do
  not have one, so this is untested.

  If you make any modifications or improvements to the code, I would appreciate
  that you share the code with me so that I might include it in the next release.
