This is an arduino library for using the Wii Nunchuck.

It uses Peter Fleury's excellent i2c library instead of Wire.h,
slightly modified to include a timeout feature on initialization.  

Recent updates:
    August 18, 2012 - Added support for the Arduino Mega, which has a different RBx pin for the nunchuck select.
    August 11, 2012 - Changed initialization bytes to support knock-off nunchucks
    January 18, 2012 - Arduino 1.0 compatability fix
