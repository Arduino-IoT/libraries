- Put license information
- webserver example with debugging not working (without debugging it works)
- correct connect() -- SYN+ACK is not being received/read (maybe the SYN we are sending is not ok)
- send is not working properly: disconnect that is really sending packets
- recv is not working for length > 1
- if we have a packet size greater than BUFFER_SIZE ... ?
- implement send
- implement connect
