This is an arduino compatible code. 

In brief it does the following:
Speaks the LinkSprite JPEG TTL Camera protocol
Saves image data on a file on a microSD
Injects gps data into the image 

Note A: To get max serial baudrate (115200) use a 7.3Mhz crystal
Note B: Input voltage 3v3
Note C: Picture names only in 7.3 format
Note D: Up to 9999 different names can be saved. Then it will roll back to 0 and overwrite. 
Note E:	EEPROM[0] & EEPROM[1] are used to keep the last picture ID so in case of reboot naming continues from last ID.
Note F: When reprogramming the AVR all EEPROM contents are overwritten with 0xFF causing picture ID to roll back to 0.
