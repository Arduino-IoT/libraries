[![alt text](images/Logo.png "Makeblock Logo") Library v2.1.0916](https://www.Makeblock.cc)

Arduino library for Makeblock electronic modules

> This library replace the Me_Lib_V2.0, this new library is rebuild and improved, we recommend all Makeblock customers to use this one.

How to use:

1. Download the zip package: https://github.com/Makeblock-official/Makeblock-Library/archive/master.zip

2. Decompress the makeblock folder in the zip to the Arduino default library:

        Windows 7: C:\Users\user name\Documents\Arduino\libraries   
        OSX:  /Users/username/Documents/Arduino/libraries"

    Your Arduino library folder should now look like this (on Windows):

        My Documents\Arduino\libraries\Makeblock\Makeblock.cpp
  
        My Documents\Arduino\libraries\Makeblock\Makeblock.h
  
        My Documents\Arduino\libraries\Makeblock\examples
        ....

    or like this (on Mac):

        Documents/Arduino/libraries/Makeblock/Makeblock.cpp
  
        Documents/Arduino/libraries/Makeblock/Makeblock.h
  
        Documents/Arduino/libraries/Makeblock/examples
        ...

    or similarly for Linux. 

3. Open the Arduino Application. If already open it, you need to restart to see changes.

4. Click "File->Examples". Here are some test program.

5. For information on installing libraries, check the [official arduino docs](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries)
